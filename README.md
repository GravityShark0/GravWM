# GravWM
### a quest to make the perfect the rice (or desktop environment?)


goal 1: make a beutiful rice that still has a nice lightweight footprint
goal 2: is to make a one command setup from blinking cursor, to a completely riced out wm/de with my own theme and possibly allow for others
 
i have 2 options
remain suckless with dwm or
use awesomewm, quitle, xmonad, or bspwm to save my sanity

option 1
To be included:
wm: bloated dwm
terminal: st
app finder: dmenu
compositor: xcompmgr/pijulius picom
txt editor: nvchad
widgets: eww widgets
extra: xmenu

option 2
wm: options
launcher: dmenu/rofi
comositor: xcompmgr/pijulius picom
text editor: nvchad
widgets: awesome widgets or eww widgets
 
To Do:
Make the Grav theme
Setup the wm
Maybe use polybar/lemonbar/tint2 or the default bar
Setup st 
Setup dmenu/rofi
Setup compositor

Setup nvchad
Setup awesome/Eww widgets

Maybe to do:
Make a custom font
Make 3 custom backgrounds
Add a fish/zsh profile
