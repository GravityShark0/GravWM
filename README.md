# GravWM
### a quest to make the perfect the rice (or desktop environment?)


- goal 1: make a beutiful rice that still has a nice lightweight footprint
- goal 2: is to make a one command setup from blinking cursor, to a completely riced out wm/de with my own theme and possibly allow for others
 
i have 2 options
- remain suckless with dwm or
- reconfigure dwm xmonad,
- use awesomewm, qtitle, or bspwm to save my sanity but lower the lightweighted ness
primitive wm testing
```
xmonad 179-183m-         0.3               4.0
base dwm 165-185m-      0.8               2.6
my dwm 154-167m-         0.9              30.3 and very laggy
bspwm 158-172m-           0.1 and 0.1  cant tell but laggy and jumps to 100%
qtile 167-192m-               2.2               56 but still responsive
awesomewm 195-203m- 2.2 and 2.2   74.0 and just laggy even when switching
```
